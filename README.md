### README

#### E-commerce FAQ Chatbot Training with Transformers

This project involves training a conversational chatbot model using Transformers library with a dataset containing frequently asked questions (FAQs) and corresponding answers related to e-commerce. The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and formatted into a chat-friendly format. The model is then trained using the provided data, and the training process involves fine-tuning a pre-trained conversational language model.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries:
- transformers
- datasets
- accelerate

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install transformers datasets accelerate
```

#### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Ensure you have the dataset file "Ecommerce_FAQ_Chatbot_dataset.json" in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
4. The code will load, preprocess, and format the dataset into a chat-friendly format.
5. It then initializes a pre-trained conversational language model and trains it on the provided dataset.
6. The training process involves fine-tuning the model's parameters using an optimizer and updating the weights based on the loss calculated during training.
7. After training, the model is ready to be used for generating responses to user queries related to e-commerce FAQs.

#### Features

- Loads and preprocesses e-commerce FAQ dataset.
- Formats the dataset into a chat-friendly format suitable for training conversational models.
- Initializes and fine-tunes a pre-trained conversational language model using Transformers library.
- Trains the model on the provided dataset to generate responses to user queries.
- Provides logging and monitoring of training progress, including loss calculation and optimization.
